# NMRS-POC-OMODS
These sets of modules are required for the full functionality of NMRS POC but the modules are not bundles with the NMRS-POC war file.
The modules whould be downloaded and copied to the .OpenMRS/modules folder after a new installation.
Remember to restart the tomcat after copying the modules into the folder for the changes to be effective.
